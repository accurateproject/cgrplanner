# CGRPlan
Web tool for creating [CGRateS][] input.

You can find this tool online [here][] or you can install it as a [web2py][] application and use it locally.

## Current status
The app is in a proof of concept state. If there will be enough interess shown for it we will add the final touches to make it usable in production.
